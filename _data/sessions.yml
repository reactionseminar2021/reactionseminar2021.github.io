  title: "First principles calculations of light-ion reactions"
  description: "Arriving at a predictive modeling of big-bang nucleosynthesis and stellar interiors relies on having a robust understanding of the nuclear reactions that are essential building blocks of such processes. First-principles calculations have made great strides during the past years in bridging the gap from fundamental nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon interactions derived from chiral effective field theory to the description of nuclear structure and dynamics. In this talk I will outline the basic principles of the no-core shell model with continuum, an ab initio approach aimed at describing the interface between structure and dynamics in nuclei, and discuss recent efforts in extending its applicability to Î±-induced reactions, as well as ongoing efforts for quantifying the uncertainties arising from chiral effective field theory to nuclear reaction predictions.
