  title: "The IAV for inclusive breakup: recent applications and perspectives"
  description: "In recent years, the study of inclusive breakup reactions has received renewed interest thanks to its many potential applications in the interpretation of nuclear reaction experiments with both stable and unstable beams. In this presentation, I will briefly review the inclusive breakup model proposed in the 1980s by Ichimura, Ichimura, Austern, and Vincent (IAV) and discuss its connection with other inclusive breakup models, such as the Hussein-McVoy model and its eikonal version, which has been standardly employed in the analysis of nucleon knockout reactions.

I will also outline some possible extensions and applications of the IAV model, including the evaluation of incomplete fusion cross sections and the indirect extraction of cross sections through the so-called surrogate method."

  title: "Complete and incomplete fusion of weakly-bound projectiles on heavy targets"
  description: "We present a detailed discussion of a recently proposed method to evaluate complete and incomplete fusion cross sections for weakly bound systems. The method is applied to collisions of 7Li projectiles on different heavy targets, and the results are compared with the available data. The overall agreement between experiment and theory is fairly good. Some preliminary results on 6Li projectiles are also presented."

  title: "From one to many: a neutral history"
  description: 'Already in the early 1960s, when physicists started to move away from the valley of stability, some ambitious ones tried to put several neutrons together and create "neutral nuclei" in their laboratories. They didn’t succeed, but the task was a very difficult (while fascinating) one, both from the construction and the detection points of view. Fascination overcame difficulty and other physicists kept trying to find these objects, that would defy nuclear theory as we know it, all through the XX century. Finally, in this XXI century two signals of a possible tetraneutron state close to threshold were obtained, first at GANIL and then at RIKEN, that were weak but have not been contested yet. They have triggered a lot of new theoretical calculations, as well as new generation experiments that try to reveal something that has eluded firm evidence for sixty years already. I will review some of the most exotic experiments, highlight their merits and drawbacks, and show why the present ones think they will succeed where so many others have failed. The game might be over soon, whatever the outcome.'

    title: "Statistical Analysis of Reactions to Extract an Optical Potential"
    description: "The optical potential is a crucial ingredient in modeling nuclear reactions. However, it is still the main contributor to theoretical uncertainties in calculations of reaction cross sections. It is essential that these uncertainties be reduced, especially when considering reactions involving isotopes far from stability. We combine the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework with the optical model to determine posterior distributions of the optical potential parameters. We then make use of different statistical tools to explore what can be learned from reaction and total cross sections, elastic scattering angular distributions and polarization data. We finally discuss the opportunities that Bayesian experimental design offers for the future."

  title: "Reaction dynamics with neutron and proton halo beams."
  description: "The region of the nuclear chart corresponding to light radioactive nuclei has, over the years, yielded many surprising results, among others the discovery of the halo structure in neutron and proton dripline nuclei.
<br>We have performed a systematic investigation of the reaction studies around the Coulomb barrier of collisions induced by neutron halo beams and, recently, of the proton halo 8B beam. In this talk an overview of the most relevant results that have been obtained so far will be given highlighting the differences in the reaction process between neutron and proton halos."

  title: "Shell effects in fission and quasifission"
  description: "Fission of atomic nuclei is often affected by quantum effects leading to asymmetric mass splits.
Quantum shells stabilising fission fragments with various shapes have been invoked
 as a factor determining the distribution of nucleons between the fragments at scission.
While spherical shell effects in 132Sn are responsible for the symmetric fission mode in neutron rich fermiums, octupole shell effects have been invoked to explain the fact that the centroid of the heavy fragment charge distribution is found around  Z=54 in actinide asymmetric fission.
Shell effects have also been recently identified, both theoretically and experimentally, in the quasifission process.
Quasifission occurs in fully damped heavy-ion collisions following a significant mass transfer from the heavy to the light fragment, without formation of a compound nucleus.
In this talk, we use time-dependent mean-field approaches to investigate and compare the shell effects affecting the fragments formation in both fission and quasifission.
In particular, we discuss the possibility to use quasifission to study fission modes in superheavy nuclei, which would benefit from the fact that quasifission cross-sections are much larger than for fusion-fission. "

  title: "Potential roots of deep sub-barrier heavy-ion fusion hindrance phenomenon within the sudden approximation approach"
  description: "We analyse the origin of the unexpected deep sub-barrier heavy-ion fusion hindrance in 64Ni+100Mo, 64Ni+64Ni and  28Si+64$Ni reactions, and so on. Our analysis is based on the improved coupled-channels  description, implemented  by means of the finite element method. With the aid of the Woods-Saxon potential, we found that the account on the non-diagonal matrix elements of the coupling matrix, traditionally neglected in the conventional  coupled-channels approaches in setting the left boundary conditions inside the potential pocket, and its minimal value are crucially important for the interpretation of experimental data. This finding provides the efficient way of the microscopic description of the deep sub-barrier hindrance of heavy-ion reactions, which is confirmed by  a good agreement with the general trend of the experimental data for the S-factor."

  title: "Two-neutron transfer reactions as a tool to study the interplay between shape coexistence and quantum phase transitions"
  description: "The atomic mass table presents zones where the structure of the states changes rapidly as a function of the neutron or proton number. The observed fundamental phenomena can be understood in terms of either shape coexistence or quantum phase transitions.  I will try to show that two-neutron transfer intensities between the 0+ states in the parent and daughter nuclei can be used as an observable that can distinguish between the two situations. Using as structure framework for this study the Interacting Boson Model (IBM), including its version with configuration mixing (IBM-CM), we discuss the cases of the isotopic chains in Zirconium, Platinum and Samarium.

  title: "Reaction cross sections of drip-line nuclei with the Gamow Shell Model"
  description: "Nuclei far away from the valley of stability are actively studied at experimental and theoretical levels. Due to their small nucleon separation energies, nuclei at drip-lines can present halos in the asymptotic region and nuclear states can be unbound with respect to particle emission.

<br>A nuclear model able to treat drip-line nuclei consistently is the Gamow Shell model (GSM). GSM is a configuration interaction model based on the use of the one-body Berggren basis, which contains bound, resonance and scattering states. Inter-nucleon correlations are taken into account via the use of configuration mixing, so that both structure and reaction degrees of freedom are included in GSM.

<br>We will firstly present applications of GSM concerning the spectra of light nuclei. GSM has also been extended to the study of reaction observables. Scattering and radiative capture cross sections of light nuclei involving nucleon and deuteron projectiles will be presented for that matter. In particular, the important topic of transfer (d,p) reactions will be discussed."

  title: "First principles calculations of light-ion reactions"
  description: "Arriving at a predictive modeling of big-bang nucleosynthesis and stellar interiors relies on having a robust understanding of the nuclear reactions that are essential building blocks of such processes. First-principles calculations have made great strides during the past years in bridging the gap from fundamental nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon interactions derived from chiral effective field theory to the description of nuclear structure and dynamics. In this talk I will outline the basic principles of the no-core shell model with continuum, an ab initio approach aimed at describing the interface between structure and dynamics in nuclei, and discuss recent efforts in extending its applicability to α-induced reactions, as well as ongoing efforts for quantifying the uncertainties arising from chiral effective field theory to nuclear reaction predictions.

  title: "Theoretical study on multichannel breakup reactions"
  description: "In the continuum-discretized coupled-channel method (CDCC), a breakup cross section (BUX) is obtained as an admixture of several components of different channels in multichannel scattering. For example, for 6Li scattering in four-body CDCC (n+p+α+T, where T is a target), the resultant three-body BUX (6Li+T→d+α+T) and the four-body BUX (6Li+T→n+p+α+T) are mixed because of the discretization of the projectile wave functions. In principle, it is possible to disentangle the cross section into three-body and four-body channel components if the exact three-body wave functions are prepared under the proper boundary condition. However, performing that calculation is hard and impractical.
In this talk, we propose a practical method for decomposing discretized BUXs into components of each channel. This approximation is referred to as the “probability separation (P separation).” As an example, we consider 11Be scattering by using the three-body model with core excitation (10Be+n+T) because this scattering provides an analogy to the 6Li scattering regarding the mixture of different channels [core-ground channel (11Be+T→10Be(g.s.)+n+T) and core-excited channel (11Be+T→10Be*+n+T)]. The structural part is constructed by the particle-rotor model and the reaction part is described by the distorted-wave Born approximation. We show the validity of the P separation by comparing it with the exact solution. Finally, we apply the P separation to 6Li four-body scattering and discuss the reaction dynamics beyond simple three-body dynamics."

  title: "Alpha clustering and the cluster knockout reaction"
  description: "As schematically described in the Ikeda diagram [1], the alpha clustering is expected in light nuclei, near the alpha threshold energies in particular. Both theoretical and experimental efforts have been made over decades, and such alpha clustering phenomena are well understood in the light mass region. In contrast, the alpha clustering in the ground state is not well understood so far. An alpha-16O component in the 20Ne ground state is one of the candidates of the alpha clustering in the ground state, owing to the double magic nature of the 16O core.
  Carey et al. [2] performed the 20Ne(p,p alpha)16O reaction experiment and reported that the alpha spectroscopic factor of the alpha-16O component extracted from the reaction analysis is inconsistent with a theoretical prediction by about a factor of two.
  In Ref.[3] we have re-analyzed the knockout cross section data with a modern theoretical framework, a combination of the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics and the distorted wave impulse approximation. We confirmed that the inconsistency between the theory and the experimental result has resolved thanks to the quantitative improvement of the present framework. In this seminar, I will introduce recent achievements of reaction theory for the alpha knockout reaction, mainly on the knockout reaction from 20Ne and 16O, and challenges toward the heavier region, 48Ti [4] and Sn isotopes [5].

  title: "Three-nucleon force in (d,p) reactions"
  description: "The three-nucleon (3N) force is important for understanding the structure and dynamics of atomic nuclei and nuclear matter from first principles and it is routinely used in many ab-initio structure calculations. It is also included in calculations describing reactions involving nuclei that can be modelled as few-body systems. First calculations of elastic scattering with ab-initio potentials have also been recently reporter. However, 3N force is not considered in analyses of experimental data involving direct reactions with complex nuclei. One particular class of such reactions, deuteron stripping (d,p) and pick-up (p,d), is an important experimental tool for testing the shell-model picture of atomic nuclei, which is often used for indirect determination of nucleon capture reaction rates at astrophysical energies. In this talk I will describe recent advances in clarifying the role of the 3N force in (d,p) reactions."
