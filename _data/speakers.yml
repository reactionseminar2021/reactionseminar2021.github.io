  title: "Professor"
  bio: '<br>Antonio Moro is Professor at the Department of Atomic, Molecular and Nuclear Physics of the University of Seville (Spain). He works in theoretical nuclear physics, with emphasis in the description of the structure and reactions of weakly-bound and exotic nuclei.

<br>He obtained his PhD at the University of Seville (2001). Then, he moved to the Technical University of Lisbon where he worked as a postdoctoral fellow. In 2004, he returned to the University of Seville with a research contract, and in 2010 he became associate professor at this University.

<br>Much of his research work has been performed in close collaboration with experimental groups, participating actively in the interpretation of nuclear reaction data measured at several radioactive beam facilities, such as ISOLDE (CERN), GANIL (France), RIBRAS (Brazil), Notre Dame (USA) and RIBF-RIKEN (Japan). At present, A.M. Moro is member of the INTC committee (ISOLDE/n_TOF) and the B-PAC of the RCNP facility at Osaka University.'
