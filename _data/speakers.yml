  title: "Professor"
  bio: '<br>Antonio Moro is Professor at the Department of Atomic, Molecular and Nuclear Physics of the University of Seville (Spain). He works in theoretical nuclear physics, with emphasis in the description of the structure and reactions of weakly-bound and exotic nuclei.

<br>He obtained his PhD at the University of Seville (2001). Then, he moved to the Technical University of Lisbon where he worked as a postdoctoral fellow. In 2004, he returned to the University of Seville with a research contract, and in 2010 he became associate professor at this University.

<br>Much of his research work has been performed in close collaboration with experimental groups, participating actively in the interpretation of nuclear reaction data measured at several radioactive beam facilities, such as ISOLDE (CERN), GANIL (France), RIBRAS (Brazil), Notre Dame (USA) and RIBF-RIKEN (Japan). At present, A.M. Moro is member of the INTC committee (ISOLDE/n_TOF) and the B-PAC of the RCNP facility at Osaka University.'

  surname: "Marqués"
  company: "LPC-Caen"
  title: ""
  bio: 'Miguel Marqués made his PhD between GANIL-Caen and IFIC-Valencia on “Bose-Einstein correlations between hard photons produced in heavy-ion collisions”. In 1994 he moved to LPC-Caen to work in a completely different field, the structure of exotic nuclei, and joined the CNRS one year later. Most of his research is focused on the study of correlations and research of new phenomena in very neutron-rich light nuclei. In doing so he has explored the application of original techniques, such as neutron interferometry, proton radiative capture, beta-delayed neutron emission, observation of multi-neutron resonances, or the detection of neutron clusters. Since 2012 most of his experimental activity takes place at RIKEN, and he is presently involved in the extension of the NEBULA multineutron array.'
