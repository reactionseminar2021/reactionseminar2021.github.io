  bio: '<br>Antonio Moro is Associate Professor at the Department of Atomic, Molecular and Nuclear Physics of the University of Seville (Spain). He works in theoretical nuclear physics, with emphasis in the description of the structure and reactions of weakly-bound and exotic nuclei.

<br>He obtained his PhD at the University of Seville (2001). Then, he moved to the Technical University of Lisbon where he worked as a postdoctoral fellow. In 2004, he returned to the University of Seville with a research contract, and in 2010 he became associate professor at this University.

<br>Much of his research work has been performed in close collaboration with experimental groups, participating actively in the interpretation of nuclear reaction data measured at several radioactive beam facilities, such as ISOLDE (CERN), GANIL (France), RIBRAS (Brazil), Notre Dame (USA) and RIBF-RIKEN (Japan). At present, A.M. Moro is member of the INTC committee (ISOLDE/n_TOF) and the B-PAC of the RCNP facility at Osaka University.'

  title: "Research Associate"
  bio: 'Jagjit Singh is working as a Research Associate at Research centre
for Nuclear Physics (RCNP), Osaka University, Japan in the group of
Prof. K. Ogata and a visiting researcher at Akal University, Punjab, India.
He has completed his PhD from the University of Padova, Italy under
supervision of Prof. L. Fortunato and Prof. A. Vitturi. He has worked as a
Research Associate at Indian Institute of Technology(IIT), Roorkee, India in
group of Prof. R. Chatterjee for a few months, followed by two and half year
postdoctoral fellowship at Nuclear Reaction data center (JCPRG) and
Theoretical Nuclear Physics Laboratory (TNPL) at Hokkaido University Sapporo,
Japan. During his stay at Hokkaido he worked in collaboration with Dr. W. Horiuchi.
His major research interests are the theoretical investigation of the structure and
reaction studies of the nuclei lying away from the valley of stability using few-body
approaches. Recently he is involved in the three-body structure investigation for various
Borromean nuclei and three/four-body breakup reaction studies using continuum-discretized
coupled-channels method (CDCC). His research interests also include nuclear reaction data
compilation and evaluation activity.'
